Implementation methods Checkout offers several ways to accept payments. You can use the prebuild payment module on your website or application. If you want to customize your payment workflow, you can build your own integration using Checkout APIs. Payment module Checkout offers a payment module where the payment information can be capture for the pressing of a transaction APIs Checkout also APIs that can be invoked directly from the commerce site. In this way, merchants can control the interface where the customer enters the payment information and only use the services for processing and authorizing the payment. Payment services Checkout includes several payment services that can be used through Web Checkout or consume directly through the Direct Connection. Some of these services include a graphical interface and others are web services without graphical interface. Payment Module Web Checkout A secure web page that allows the capture of the customer's payment information and process the transaction. This reduces the risk of the transaction, since the sensitive information provided by the client is handled only by Web Checkout. Web Checkout has a \"responsive\" interface which adjusts to the size of the screen of the device that is being accessed, allowing the customer experience to be the same always. APIs Process Credit Service for the processing of payment, void and refund of transactions with a Visa, MasterCard and American Express Process ACH Service for the processing of payment and reverse of transactions with a checking or savings bank account Process Wallet Service that allows the merchant to save a payment method (credit card or bank account) of a customer and process payments, reversals and refunds at any time using the saved payment method. Typically, it is used for recurring payments or subscriptions. The customer's payment information is tokenized and stored in a secure environment. Each client must be registered in the service. A unique identifier will be assigned per client that the merchant will have to provide in order to make future charges. Transaction Search Service that consults and provides the status of a transaction. It helps commerce to improve the user experience by being able to know the status of a transaction at any time. It is also very useful for customer service issues. Important Information To ensure the security of the data from the customers and merchants and to comply with PCI DSS, we have established the following procedures: Every connection from the merchant\u2019s application to any of our services has to be made through TLS 1.2 or greater. All communications between Evertec and the merchant will be processed through https requests. When a merchant registers for the service they are assigned a username and password. The merchant uses the username / password combination as a key for payment requests. The merchant must provide a list IP addresses from which the payment service will be accessed. This means that in each call to the service, the merchant identification is validated, as well as the address from which the call is made. All merchants have to complete the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) . This questionnaire is designed as a self-validation tool to assess security for cardholder data. The SAQ includes a series of yes-or-no questions for each applicable PCI Data Security Standard requirement. There are different questionnaires available to meet different merchant environments. You can easily find the SAQ that best describes how you accept payment cards. To help merchants complete the SAQ, we have a portal available which allows them to complete the questionnaire annually https://pciportal.gmsectec.com/Merchant/MerchantRegistration .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#checkout-technical-documentation","text":"Checkout is a complete online payment solution that allows merchants to easily accept electronic payments of credit cards, debit cards (including the ATH\u00ae debit card with PIN, the debit card most commonly used in Puerto Rico) and checking and savings accounts through the ACH network.","title":"Checkout Technical Documentation"},{"location":"#implementation-methods","text":"Checkout offers several ways to accept payments.

Closing Process On a daily basis, the Web Payment Service automatically executes a closing process for the transactions performed by the Merchant. This process generates three results for Merchant: a text file called MMPTran.txt with the authorized payment transactions, a file text called logfile.txt with all the existing data in the system regarding the transactions performed during the processing day, regardless of whether they were approved, rejected or incomplete, and a .pdf report with the authorized transactions. The returns can be included in this report if requested by the merchant. This process is scheduled to be performed each labor day at 3:00 PM, the time of the close of transactions.

The result of a transaction is sent to the merchant using the http POST method to a URL address specified by the merchant. The Online Response is generated at the same time that the client receives the payment confirmation. Conditions Evertec, Inc. is not responsible for the security measures implemented by the merchant to protect the sent information or the functionality of this webpage. A transaction is considered completed once the client saw the Payment Confirmation screen. It is the merchant responsibility to make daily closings with the closing files sent every night. If the merchant does not receive the data of a completed transaction, the completed transaction will not be reversed. It is the merchant responsibility to use payment data to update their applications. Please make sure not to include the data more than once to avoid duplicate payments. The URL (https) that will receive the transaction data will be developed and published by the Merchant.

explains the details of integration of the Web Checkout service Payment Process Description The process begins with the merchant, when a client clicks the payment button implemented in the merchant\u2019s website, after the merchant displayed the amount to be paid to the customer. The amount will remain unchanged when being sent to the service; the transaction will reflect what the merchant sends as the paid amount. The merchant\u2019s application processes the client\u2019s payment through the web service, which links it to Web Checkout. When the merchant uses the web service, the web service call must include the parameters specified in this section The web service receives the merchant\u2019s request and redirects to Web Checkout. This Payment Service consists of three main pages. The first page asks the Client to select a payment method, the second page displays the information the Client just entered for confirmation, and a third page shows the result of the payment transaction. Customizable Screen Elements This section presents the different screens elements that Web Checkout allows merchants to customize. Payment Methods In Web Checkout the merchant has the ability to accept the following methods of payment: ACH (personal, savings, commercial) Visa credit & debit card MasterCard credit & debit card American Express credit card ATH\u00ae debit card from financial institutions certified by the ATH\u00ae Network Payment Method Selection Screen The previous image shows the screen where the client selects the payment method and it includes references to the merchant customizable elements. Reference Description 1 Merchant image or logo. Must be in JPEG format and must not exceed the 100KB. The dimensions for the logo/image are 700 x 100. 2 Title that identifies the customer (i.e. Subscriber, Insured, etc.) 3 The merchant can specify the label to identify the accountID parameter sent in the parameters (i.e. Subscription, Membership, etc.). Note : Depending on the sensitivity of this information, the Merchant may choose a mask that shows only the last 4 digits. 4 The merchant can specify a URL to which the client will be returned to if the button is pressed. Note : By default, this button just closes the window/tab 5 Label for the Return Policy link (i.e. Terms & Conditions, etc.). Note : By default, value is Refund Policy Address Verification Service The Address Verification System (AVS) is a system used to verify the address of a person claiming to own a credit card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by the user with the address on file at the credit card company or issuing bank. Checkout offers this service in a limited way. When active, Checkout will request the zip code related to the billing address of the credit card and send the information in the authorization message. If the zip codes do not match, Checkout will automatically reverse the transaction (if it was authorized) and display a message to the customer indicating that they need to review the payment information. This service is only available for Web Checkout. Implementation The merchant must be registered in Evertec\u2019s Checkout service and must have a username and a password. Evertec must also know the IP address from which the merchant will access the service. Therefore, the programming to use the service must be on the server side to validate correctly the IP address from which the service is being accessed. Once the Merchant has sent the required parameters to the web service, it will return a response in case of a successful verification, the Web Checkout URL is: https://checkout.evertecinc.com/V2?Token+Language . The merchant has to redirect the customer to the URL of this response. In case of an unsuccessful transaction, the service may return: a code with an error number (See possible response codes on the \u201cResponse Codes\u201d section) or an error message. The programmer must have special considerations when programming the payment button. For example, once the user clicks on the button, it may become disabled and display a message that indicates that the transaction is being processed.

When active, Checkout will request the zip code related to the billing address of the credit card and send the information in the authorization message.

Evertec must also know the IP address from which the merchant will access the service.

Once the Merchant has sent the required parameters to the web service, it will return a response in case of a successful verification, the Web Checkout URL is: https://checkout.evertecinc.com/V2?Token+Language .
